I created this text adventure game to demonstrate my understanding of Python. I have played a lot of fantasy based games like Dungeons and Dragons. Text adventure games were a bit before my time, so creating one sounded like a lot of fun and a good way to learn Python. It is certainly not a typical use for Python, but I think it still contains the same techniques found in a more typical use of Python.

Goblin Crypt is a text adventure game played through a hosting app called Heroku. It is made up of these sections:

1. Start screen / title screen.
2. Past adventures screen / score screen.
3. Main game sections.
4. Death screen / play again screen.
5. Winning screen.
